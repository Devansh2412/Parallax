# Parallax
The provided HTML and CSS code constructs a visually engaging parallax website that features a dynamic, multi-layered visual experience. The HTML framework establishes a webpage with a central container that includes two layered images and a header, followed by multiple content sections each with parallax background images and descriptive text.

In the HTML structure, the `wrapper` div encapsulates the entire content, ensuring a cohesive visual layout. Inside, the `container` div includes two images (`background.png` and `foreground.png`) that create the parallax effect when combined with the heading "ADVENTURE". Following this, a `section` element presents multiple blocks of text interspersed with parallax background images, each dedicated to a specific adventure activity like biking, paragliding, and surfing.

The CSS begins with a universal selector (*) to reset margins, padding, and box-sizing, ensuring a consistent look across different browsers. The `wrapper` is styled to occupy the full viewport height and includes perspective settings essential for the parallax effect. The `container` is centrally aligned and employs `transform-style: preserve-3d` to maintain the 3D transformation effects on child elements.

The `background` and `foreground` images within the container are positioned absolutely, with transformations applied to create depth perception. The `background` image is scaled and translated further back along the z-axis, while the `foreground` image is brought slightly forward, both contributing to the layered parallax illusion. These images span the entire container, ensuring a seamless visual.

The main header (`h1`) is prominently positioned at the top with significant font size and white color, enhanced by a subtle text-shadow for readability against varying backgrounds.

The `section` element provides a dark background color, contrasting with the white text for readability. The headings within the section (`secHeading`) and paragraph text (`text`) are styled for clarity and visual hierarchy, using padding for alignment and margin for spacing.

Each `.bg` div within the section acts as a parallax background, fixed to create the scrolling illusion. These background images are full-width, centrally positioned, and cover their respective divs. The `desc` class styles the descriptive text within each background image, positioning it centrally with a white background for contrast and readability.

Overall, this code delivers an immersive, responsive parallax website ideal for showcasing adventure themes or dynamic content, enhancing user engagement through layered visuals and smooth scrolling effects.
